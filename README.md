# IP-Scanner-and-MAC-Address-Detector
IP Scanner and MAC Address Detector is a networking tool that automatically detects the local network's IP address and subnet mask, generates a list of all the available IP addresses on the network, and retrieves the corresponding MAC address for each IP.

IP Scanner and MAC Address Detector is a useful networking tool that automates the process of network documentation, making it quicker and easier for administrators and IT professionals to identify and troubleshoot network issues. The program automatically detects the local network's IP address and subnet mask, and pings all the available IP addresses automatically on the network with the corresponding MAC address, which is stored in an ARP table.

By eliminating the need to manually ping each IP address and document the corresponding MAC addresses, IP Scanner and MAC Address Detector streamlines the process of network documentation, saving time and effort while providing a comprehensive overview of the network's connected devices. This makes it a valuable and essential tool for organizations seeking to improve network efficiency and security, making it a useful asset for administrators and IT professionals.
