IP Scanner and MAC Address Detector is a networking tool that automatically detects your local network's IP address and subnet mask, generates a list of all available IP addresses on the network, and retrieves the corresponding MAC address for each IP. This tool streamlines the process of network documentation, making it quicker and easier for administrators and IT professionals to identify and troubleshoot network issues.

By eliminating the need to manually ping each IP address and document the corresponding MAC addresses, this program saves time and effort while providing a comprehensive overview of the network's connected devices. It is a valuable asset for organizations seeking to improve network efficiency and security.
